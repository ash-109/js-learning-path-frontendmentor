In this path, we'll cover the basics of creating interactive web pages and applications using JavaScript.

Overview

This path includes six JavaScript-based challenges that will expose you to different challenges and allow you to experience different but common problems that front-end developers face daily.

The path is designed to gradually increase complexity while also providing helpful guidance along the way. However, unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript has a steeper learning curve and can sometimes be quite frustrating. The key to success is to stick with it and take your time.

We recommend using vanilla JavaScript to tackle these challenges and avoid modern JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue at this stage. This will help you grasp the fundamentals and give you a great foundation to build on in later learning paths.

We also recommend that once you've completed a challenge, you take some time to look at solutions posted by other community members. There are literally thousands of different solutions on Frontend Mentor for the challenges on this learning path, and each one can give you new ideas and approaches for solving the same problem.

If you have the time, it's always worth trying a different approach to a solution you've already completed. Think about how this new approach is better than your previous attempt, the ways it is worse, and what lessons you learned from doing it a second time.
